## 🇰🇬 Forex Trading in Kuwait: Overview

Kuwait is a financially advanced country in the GCC with a strong demand for currency trading. While the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) oversees traditional financial markets, **retail Forex trading is mostly done through international brokers**.

### Key Highlights:

* Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) is one of the strongest global currencies.
* Residents often trade USD/KWD, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and Gold.
* International brokers dominate due to the lack of local licensing.

## ✅ Choosing a Regulated Forex Broker in Kuwait

To ensure fund safety and legal compliance, pick brokers with:

* **Tier-1 Licenses**: FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), CySEC (EU), FSCA (South Africa)
* **Islamic/Swap-free Accounts**: Essential for Shariah-compliant trading
* **Low spreads and commissions**
* **Arabic support and Gulf-based payment methods** (like KNET or local banks)
* **Mobile compatibility**
