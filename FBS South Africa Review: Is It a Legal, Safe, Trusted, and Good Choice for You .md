## 🛡️ Is FBS Legal in South Africa?

Yes, **FBS is legal to use in South Africa**, even though it is **not regulated by the [FSCA](https://www.fsca.co.za/Pages/Default.aspx)** (Financial Sector Conduct Authority). Instead, FBS operates legally via its offshore entities:

- **FBS Markets Inc.** – regulated by **IFSC Belize**
- **Tradestone Ltd** – regulated by **CySEC** (European clients)

While FSCA regulation would provide added local security, the broker can still legally provide services through international licenses. Thousands of South African traders are already using FBS without legal issues.

---

## 🔐 Is FBS Safe and Regulated?

FBS is regulated under two trusted international regulators:

- 🔹 **IFSC Belize** (License No. IFSC/000102/198)  
- 🔹 **CySEC Cyprus** (License No. 331/17)

While these are not as strong as tier-1 regulators like FCA or ASIC, they **do enforce financial transparency, client fund segregation, and fair trading practices**.

Security features:

- 🔐 SSL encryption for data protection
- 💼 Negative balance protection
- 🔒 Segregated client accounts

⚠️ **Note**: Since FSCA does not regulate FBS, South African traders may not be eligible for local dispute resolution. However, thousands of South Africans have traded with FBS without security concerns.
