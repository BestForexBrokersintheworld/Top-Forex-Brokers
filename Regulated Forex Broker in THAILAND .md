## Understanding Forex Trading in Thailand

Forex trading in Thailand is legal and regulated by two main authorities:

- **Bank of Thailand (BOT):** Oversees the country's monetary policies and ensures financial stability.
- **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** Regulates securities and exchange markets, including forex trading activities.

While there are restrictions on trading the Thai Baht (THB) to prevent excessive speculation and maintain economic stability, Thai residents can legally trade forex through **international brokers** that comply with BOT and SEC regulations.
