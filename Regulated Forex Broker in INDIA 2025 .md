## Regulatory Landscape in India

### 2.1 SEBI Oversight  
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) licenses brokers for currency derivatives on recognized exchanges (NSE, BSE, MSE). All spot-forex trading is prohibited‚Äîonly exchange-traded futures/options are allowed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).  
‚úÖ **Key point:** SEBI mandates client fund segregation and stringent reporting.

### 2.2 RBI Guidelines  
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supervises forex operations through the Electronic Trading Platforms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018. Only licensed ETPs may offer forex instruments to residents.  
‚úÖ **Allowed pairs:** USD/INR, EUR/INR, GBP/INR, JPY/INR; cross-currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD) via recognized derivatives.  
‚úÖ **Hedging rule (2024):** Trades strictly for hedging underlying exposure, not pure speculation.

### 2.3 Allowed Instruments & Pairs  
- **Exchange-traded futures & options** on INR-based pairs  
- **Currency ETFs** and mutual funds (indirect exposure)  
- **Non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)** offshore (for institutional clients)
