## Regulatory Landscape in India

### 2.1 SEBI Oversight  
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) licenses brokers for currency derivatives on recognized exchanges (NSE, BSE, MSE). All spot-forex trading is prohibited—only exchange-traded futures/options are allowed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).  
✅ **Key point:** SEBI mandates client fund segregation and stringent reporting.

### 2.2 RBI Guidelines  
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supervises forex operations through the Electronic Trading Platforms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018. Only licensed ETPs may offer forex instruments to residents.  
✅ **Allowed pairs:** USD/INR, EUR/INR, GBP/INR, JPY/INR; cross-currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD) via recognized derivatives.  
✅ **Hedging rule (2024):** Trades strictly for hedging underlying exposure, not pure speculation.

### 2.3 Allowed Instruments & Pairs  
- **Exchange-traded futures & options** on INR-based pairs  
- **Currency ETFs** and mutual funds (indirect exposure)  
- **Non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)** offshore (for institutional clients)

---

## Why Regulation Matters for Traders

1. **Client Fund Safety** 🛡️  
   Segregation in trust accounts prevents misuse of deposits.

2. **Fair Pricing & Execution** ⚖️  
   Licensed brokers adhere to best-execution and no-dealing-desk policies.

3. **Dispute Resolution** 🔍  
   SEBI grievance redressal and RBI “Alert List” protect against unauthorized platforms.

4. **Negative Balance Protection**  
   Certain global regulators (FCA, ASIC) guarantee traders can’t lose more than deposited.
